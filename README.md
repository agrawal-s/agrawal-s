### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Shrikant Agrawal, your friendly neighbourhood Data Scientist. Recently graduated as a Master of Data Science from University of Queensland, Australia. I'm passionate about Deep Learning and Statistical methods for Data Science. I love science fiction and aspire to invent a dream detector. 



ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on:

1. <a href="https://github.com/agrawal-s/Deepfake_DCGAN/blob/main/DC_GAN_Readme.md" target="_blank" >Deep Fake</a>: Face genrator using DC-GAN.
2. <a href="https://github.com/agrawal-s/Project_Luck" target="_blank" >Project Luck</a> : Simulation study to identify how lucky you have to be to get selected in an interview process.

ðŸ’¬ You can talk to me about:
1. Machine Learning.
2. Applied probability and statistics.
3. Deep Learning.
4. Theoritical Physics.
5. Technology.
6. Sci-fi books/ TV shows/ Movies.
